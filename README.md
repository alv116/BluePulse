# BluePulse
üî∑ BluePulse ‚Äì Bluetooth Signal Drop Detector and Real-Time Analysis BluePulse is an advanced monitoring tool that detects unexpected drops in Bluetooth signal strength (RSSI) and allows you to visualize connection behavior in real time through a seismograph-like graph. It is ideal for developers, wireless network technicians, connected device manufacturers, and any environment where Bluetooth stability is critical.

üß† What does BluePulse do? It continuously monitors link quality with a paired Bluetooth device.

It detects sudden drops, micro-drops, interference, or loss of connection.

It visualizes data as a moving waveform to detect anomalous patterns.

It allows you to record entire sessions and export them for forensic or technical analysis.

‚ö†Ô∏è Bluetooth and Power Outages: What's Happening? During a widespread blackout, such as the one that occurred on April 28, 2025, across much of the Iberian Peninsula, Bluetooth is the first operating system to go down, so BluePulse can also be used to prevent these outages.

Although Bluetooth devices operate locally and do not rely on the internet, the blackout indirectly affects their operation in several ways:

üîã Power loss: Many Bluetooth devices are connected to power outlets or chargers, so they shut down when the power is cut off.

üì∂ Electromagnetic interference: Sudden changes in electrical loads can cause localized interference in the 2.4 GHz bands, where Bluetooth operates.

üîÑ Forced restarts: When devices are turned back on, Bluetooth reconnections may fail or be delayed, causing instability.

BluePulse acts as a ‚Äúseismograph‚Äù for Bluetooth connections, allowing you to accurately observe what happens to the signal before, during, and after a power outage, and identify anomalous connectivity behaviors that often go unnoticed.
